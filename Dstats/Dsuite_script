The following script was used to calculate Dstatistics with the following files:
The vcf_file was generated in polyrad
SETS_5 is to test for introgression from adg into tbr
SETS_6 is to test for reciprocal introgression (tbr into adg)
We used a newick tree to keep tree associations

./Dsuite Dtrios -t tree.nwk new_vcf_file_for_diptet_D_calc.vcf SETS_x.txt
