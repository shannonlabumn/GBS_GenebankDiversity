# Diversity_analysis_2023
This is the repository for the Tuttle et al paper:Potato soup: analysis of cultivated potato gene bank populations reveals high diversity and little structure

This repository contains the pipelines for 3 populations: diploid, tetraploid and a combined poanel that contains both diploid and tetraploid populations
PolyRad imputation was completed for all three.

Some files, especially vcf and structure files were compressed.  These will need to be uncompressed before running.
